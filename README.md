# Face Recogntion App

This project aims to extend my knowledge of React and learn full stack by integrating a Node.js/Express backend with the React frontend. It uses the Clarifai API to recognize faces in images, and maintains a leaderboard of "faces scanned" by user profile.

The full stack technologies and patterns in this project will help me develop further projects that are more dynamic than before.

Technologies: React, Node.js, Express.js
